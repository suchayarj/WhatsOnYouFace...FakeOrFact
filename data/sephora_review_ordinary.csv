The Ordinary,Skincare,P427406,117,$8.70,4.7436,Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,brown,brunette,"I’ve been using this for almost a week now. I can honestly say I was skeptical. I have dark old acne scars, the occasional random zit, and areas on my cheeks that are either enlarged pores or what I’ve heard called “pock marks”. I noticed a difference after the first night. Now, almost a week in to it, I can feel a difference, too. The scars still look the same (only been 1 week). But my overall skin looks brighter. And the areas where I have enlarged pores/pock marks feel a whole lot smoother. Makeup doesn’t automatically settle into them now. I recommend and I’m going to keep using, too!",acne,dark,oily,5,JenJoyWells

My face was full of tiny bumps. They were itchy and made their way around my entire face...first couple days were mostly on my cheeks and jawline, then moved up to my forehead. I could not get rid of them and I have many good products. I received my glycolic acid toner and tried it out. It tingled but immediately made my skin feel smoother. Not exaggerating, my skin felt about 50% smoother within 15 minutes. The bumps started to disappear. Day two I used the toner and my skin was 90% better. By the third day my skin is back to normal. I cannot say enough about this product. Now that my skin is back to smooth, I am noticing it clearing and perfecting. Love this product.",acne,medium,oily,5,jz823

I use this every other day or perhaps once or twice a week now that it’s winter and my skin is a bit drier (I’m combo- tad bit oily t zone, dry patches between the brows and around the mouth). I use it after my double cleanse with a cotton round.

I personally just spritz a little of my rose floral toner from Fresh after applying this one to eliminate the smell (which actually doesn't last too long on the skin anyways) and the stickiness while also sealing in moisture.

Lots of people compare this as a dupe to the Pixi glow tonic, i would agree with that but i think that the Pixi is gentler and better for daily use.

This toner has good strength and exfoliates nicely so it can be used 2-3 times a week and still have results
The bottle dispenses way too much product to use as directed for daily use and will cause irritation and over exfoliation (even after my skin has been used to acids) , transfer the product to an empty misting bottle and the product becomes much more gentle on the skin and more comparable to the pixi one, just a gentle daily exfoliating toner to brighten skin tone
Only 4 stars because of the bottle. I purchased this product from the Deciem website but decided to review it here
Also great for use on the body!",,,,4,Vanchetta

After a couple of days I’ve noticed that I am starting to breakout on the forehead and temples.  Being in my 40’s, I rarely breakout and I’ve read some reviews that people are breaking out.  After doing some research it seems that if you use products that have glycolic acid the skin is most likely purging it speeds up skin turnover.  This so called “adjustment period” takes approximately 4 weeks which is how long your skin renews but if you don’t see any improvement by 6-8 weeks maybe this isn’t the product for you.  Not everyone will experience this, lucky buggers.

I use it on my neck, chest, shoulders and back as well. I haven’t had any pimples since I started using this in conjunction with the aha 10% serum from the Ordinary, which is a miracle, especially during the time of the month. I even forgot to remove my makeup 2 times before bed during the holidays and I think this Saved me. Usually falling asleep before I remove my makeup ruins my skin for a least a week. I have sensitive skin and this does not make my skin burn or react. My pores look better.

The Ordinary,Skincare,P427411,61,$7.90,4.2295,Azelaic Acid Suspension 10%,green,brunette,"I have a ton of Ordinary products at this point, and have been using them since I became aware of the brand when Sephora started selling it, like 1-2 months, I guess. This product has proved to be the most difficult to apply, but maybe also the next payoff for my oily skin, chronically clogged pores, and hormonal acne. 

Like other reviewers, the first thing I noticed about this product is the high silicone content and the fact that it pills off in big, gross looking white lumps if you're not careful with when applying the next products. I've found it best to use the smallest amount of product possible, apply it in dots to whatever areas you want to cover (I always use it on my chin and chest, where I tend to break out the most, and sporadically on the rest of my face for exfoliation and glow), and distribute it by lightly patting the area with my hands until it feels smooth. Then I take a break and do something else for a few minutes to allow it to dry before finishing up my skincare routine.

I apply it over my niacinamide, and follow with Buffet (if I feel like it) and a moisturizer, making sure to apply all subsequent products very gently with a light touch, gliding the product on to my skin, and finishing by carefully patting the product in until it sets enough. If it's daytime, I make sure to finish up with sunscreen. 

I've so far been able to apply makeup on top, no problem. The main trick is to use as little product as possible and finish up with gentle patting instead of rubbing. I don't have problems with pilling when applying it that way. Also, I don't use it at the same time as retinoids, because there's no way to avoid pilling/peeling using both at once.

I find this all to be very worth it because this product works miracles for the kind of acne I get on my chin and chest, that SA and other acne treatments don't help at all. And it's cheap enough to apply regularly to your butt, back, back of the neck, or anywhere else you get stubborn acne.",acne,fair,combination,4,fearoftrains

This product helps tone down both, as well as prevent future breakouts from occurring. It doesn’t play well with makeup, so I only use it in the PM, or on days when I’m not wearing makeup at all.

I have sensitive, combination skin and was diagnosed with seborrheic dermatitis some years ago, though now I suspect I may have rosacea. I battle with redness and inflammation on my cheeks and nose, as well as the tiniest whiteheads that don’t really seem to be acne related. The SD causes my skin to become dry and scaly (similar to eczema) and is exacerbated by the dry winter air. I’ve been using this in those areas about 2-3 times a week at night and I am amazed with how much things have cleared. I’ve started out using it conservatively because of my skin being so sensitive, but I think that daily PM use would be fine. It tingles a bit after applying, but it’s not bothersome. I apply it after moisturizing with The Ordinary Hydrating Factors (to which I add argan, squalane, and rosehip oils). Some nights I add a nourishing sleep mask to seal everything in.

For the days I'm not using the retinol the Azelaic acid zaps zits and sucks up sebum resulting in clearer skin with far less oil. I apply this at night and wake up with skin that doesn't look oily and feels very soft because the Azelaic acid exfoliates the skin.

Within a week of use my rosacea, which was in the middle of a bad flare, has reduced significantly! Both the redness and texture have improved. If you have rosacea you know, you can cover the redness with makeup but you can’t hide the texture and bumps! This has also helped with a few breakouts I had at the time too.

As stated below, this does not play well with makeup and a lot of skin products! I actually came up with a modified night routine because it will pill when mixed with water based products, which is like 90% of my skincare.

What I do: I will wash, tone, essence, and moisturize (water based) and wait at least 10 minutes for it to absorb, then put on the cream.

I also rub it out on my hands then put in on my face, not slab it on.  I think I’d prefer something else more refined, but for the price you get what you pay for.

It does feel mildly sticky upon initial application, but that does go away after a few minutes. You do not need a lot. Using twice a day, each bottle lasts me a little over two months. I have been using this for six months. I wanted to write this review because I noticed some complaints about excessive stickiness and poor absorption/dry down. I think those customers may have been applying too much. After a few weeks of using, I noticed that my skin had a firmer more supple appearance and my fine lines on my forehead are reduced in size and depth. My skin is smoother overall and I think this is a very effective and wallet friendly treatment that also happens to be vegan and cruelty free. My mom has combination skin and she likes this as well.

I used this in conjunction with The Ordinary's NMF which too is inexpensive and has an impressive ingredient list, but is also cosmetically inelegant.  I had to use a whole dropper full to feel hydrated enough, and finished the bottle in a month.  For 15 dollars this is an okay hydrating serum, but don't expect anything more.  If you're young and on a budget, or new to skincare, this is an option worth considering.  But for dehydration purposes there are much better formulas out there.  I won't be repurchasing.",acne,medium,combination,3,MaxB

The Ordinary,Skincare,P427413,38,$6.79,4.7105,Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2%,green,brunette,"This and the salicylic acid treatment - used in conjunction - have transformed my sensitive, dry, dull skin. Before I started using these, I had to manually exfoliate every second day, or else foundation would gather in my dry spots, and just look terrible. That caused my skin to be more sensitive, and get drier over time. I'd get hormonal acne sometimes, probably caused by dead skin cells blocking pores, because this stuff stopped that almost completely. 

If you have potentially sensitive skin, I'd recommend using lactic acid first, twice per week, and increase (and add in salicylic acid) if you have no negative side effects - dryness, irritation, etc. Your tolerance may allow you to use them every night. 

Again, use this only at night, because it can cause increased photosensitivity. Also, you can apply lactic acid and salicylic acid at the same time - but since they both require a pH between 3-4 to remain active, use them as your first step in your nighttime routine, and let them sit for at least 20 minutes before applying anything else. This will give them ample time to do their job before you dilute them and raise the pH out of the effective range.",,porcelain,dry,5,Acidfunk

I have once tried Sunday Riley a year ago and it worked wonders to my skin, but it was just too expensive to stock up so I came across this Ordinary Lactic Acid and give it a try. Btw I have combination skin and uneven skin.

After cleansing my face, I used Pixi Glow Tonic as my toner, and added few drops of this lactic acid afterwards and let it sit for 5-10 mins (they say it will take pH of 3 for the exfoliation to occur), then applied moisturizer. The next day, I noticed some big difference!!!! I have smooth, flawless, poreless skin. I will stick to that routine! Glow tonic (or anything with glycolic acid)   Lactic acid = good combo.

The Ordinary,Skincare,P427407,85,$5.30,4.4824,Salicylic Acid 2% Solution,green,brunette,"This stuff is great for so many skin issues: dullness, flaky dry skin, acne, ingrown hairs, keratosis pilaris, inflammation, sensitivity, redness, etc. It works by dissolving the top layers of keratin that can block pores and make the surface ""harder,"" preventing hairs from sprouting, causing acne, and more.

It has an effective range of 3-4 pH (same as lactic acid, and even better when used together). This means that you should apply it first, after cleansing and patting dry, and let it sit for at least 20 min before diluting with other products.

The most common side effect is dryness, so moisturise well afterwards! You may need to increase your tolerance over a matter of weeks - starting at twice per week, and increase if able.

The Ordinary,Skincare,P427407,85,$5.30,4.4824,Salicylic Acid 2% Solution,brown,red,"Literal godsend. After fairly clear and low-maintenance skin in college, I developed cystic acne in my mid 20s. It’s been two years of battling cystic spots and general temperamental skin, during which I found other products and routine that would give me “decent” periods and faster healing time, but never really fully cleared it up. Since my most useful products all seem to use salicylic acid as the main ingredient, I gave this a try; the price obviously isn’t intimidating. After less than a week of using this once or twice a day (in addition to my other products, nothing changed there), I’m beyond thrilled that my skin cleared dramatically - I only have a few healing blemishes and haven’t seen a single new zit since starting this. This puts much more expensive acne treatments to shame (looking at you, ProActiv).

I browsed the reviews when I first ordered, and in regards to some of what they mention:
1. It’s an acid and thus can be a little drying, but it seems to balance nicely with another product of mine that I otherwise used less often because it was a little too oily. It’s very minor dryness that would easily be fixed or prevented with the right moisturizer - something to be mindful of but not turned off by. Honestly I would gladly put up with a little dryness in exchange for these results.
2. It does “foam” the tiniest bit when rubbing it in, but that vanishes almost immediately. It also happens less when I use less. Completely a non-issue.
3. It stays slightly wet at first, meaning that it doesn’t rub in like a moisturizer, but within about five minutes the excess is either absorbed or dries - so it can fit my routine just fine and I have also applied makeup afterward, just not the instant I finish applying it.",acne,porcelain,combination,5,Doppelganger

The Ordinary,Skincare,P427417,172,$5.90,4.4884,Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%,brown,blonde,I have oily combination skin that is pretty sensitive. After using this along with their Salicylic Acid Solution it has changed my skin! I use an oil control cleanser (OLEHENRIKSEN Find Your Balance) then I apply the salicylic acid solution let it dry down then put this directly over it. After it dries down I immediately put on moisturizer. This has changed the appearance of my skin and the oiliness so much. Before using this at the end of the day the makeup on and around my nose would be melted off and I would be super oily. Since using for a little over a month I have noticed that my pores appear much smaller and I am no where near as oily. I have also noticed that my skin is softer and it feels more healthy. The only thing I would think about before buying would be to take into consideration that if you won’t be wearing makeup your skin will be somewhat shinny. After it dries down and my moisturizer sinks into my skin throughout the day when I’m not wearing makeup I notice that my skin has a slightly shiny finish. When I feel my skin though it’s not oil but it’s jut the way it dries down. Under makeup it doesn’t do this and your skin will look amazing.,acne,fair,combination,4,Lauren2270

The Ordinary,Skincare,P427417,172,$5.90,4.4884,Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%,green,red,"This was one of the first products I purchased from The Ordinary, as it touted numerous benefits for my congested/acne-prone, oily, sensitive, mature skin. I’ve been battling various degrees of acne and oiliness for over 2 decades. When I wasn’t dealing with active acne, I still had nasty hyperpigmentation; purple discoloration on my otherwise very pale face. They take months to disappear and as I’m nearing my 40s, it takes even longer to heal. 
In the last year I revamped my previously minimalist skincare and started incorporating multiple steps like that of Korean skincare, and adding a few simple but effective products like those from The Ordinary. I avoid fragrances, alcohols, and other potentially unnecessary or irritating ingredients and have found that proper pH is extremely important.
The true turning point in my new skincare regime was adding in this niacinamide serum. I’d been poking around on YouTube researching skincare and listened to the recommendations of Wayne Goss and George Popovic, both of whom had absolutely awesome things to say about it and the brand. In George’s case, he reported his results after 7 and 10 months of regular use on acne-prone, oily skin and I was sold. 
While my oiliness had shown some improvement with the initial changes in my skincare routine, this serum literally slaked it. A couple of drops in the morning (I only use it in the a.m.), after I wash and tone, I pat this on my trouble areas and go about the rest of my routine. Incredible. My pores are less noticeable, the congestion is gradually disappearing, the discoloration is fading fast, and where I would normally be an oil slick by the end of the day, I simply have a healthy glow. I’ve since purchased other Ordinary products, all of which I’ve found to be fabulous and inexpensive. My true ride or die products are the niacinamide serum and the rose hip seed oil.",acne,fair,oily,5,Teethnclaws

This is a great anti blemish formula. It might take a few days to see it working since it is pretty gentle on the skin. This serum can be used with the other The ordinary serums (I use 3 or 4 in my skin care regimen) and I use it only in the morning since I want a spot for either the  Lactic acid or my Granactive retinoid in squalane (I just love this stuff) and my all time favorite, HG, call it what you want Alpha lipoic acid (which is not available on Sephora).

My skin no longer responded to ingredients that used to be so effective (benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, etc.) so I decided to try out niacinamide serum.

I can't speak to it's effect on oil production, as I have normal-dry skin. It applies nicely and adds an extra layer of hydration. My acne left my cheeks full of PIE (different than PIH) and this is slowly helping to heal it.

The Ordinary,Skincare,P427412,37,$8.90,3.9189,Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA,brown,black,"I have been using a bottle of this, on and off, for about 6 months and can honestly say that it does work to help improve the look of hyperpigmentation from breakouts.

The texture is a thick, liquid-gel like consistency, and while it applies a tiny bit sticky, the stickiness subsides as soon as skin absorbs it. I usually apply after toner and any acids, before moisturizing serums, moisturizer and face oil. It does not make makeup pill or anything (unlike a couple of other The Ordinary products).

With any skincare product, you do have to be patient. Time is the best thing for waiting for hyperpigmentation (for me the issue is post-breakout ones) but this product will help it along. If you can give the time it takes to use up the entire bottle (probably a few months with consistent AM and PM daily use) you will probably see results.

I also had an inflamed pore/papule that was lagging in healing, and applying this made a noticeable difference overnight. It wasn't all gone, but it at least improved somewhat.

My face changes constantly due to hormones, cycle, stress, and detoxing, and it’s reflected in combination skin that suffers from acne, hyper-pigmentation in the t zone, and skin peeling on the nose. 

I use alpha arbutin along with lactic acid & moisturizer in the evening, to address the redness on the cheeks. My skin clears up within 48 hrs, and then I can leave it alone for a few weeks. 

If you want to understand layering skincare, I’d suggest checking out Stephanie Nichole’s videos on YouTube (especially her The Ordinary review). She created an entire chart of how to layer the products, and the times of day to use them. 

Whether you watch it or not, never layer more than 3 products, and check to make sure that you aren’t using products that cancel each other out. DIY skincare requires real research and planning. Understand that these products are in concentrations that are effective on most skin types, that the concentrations might be strong when you introduce the product to your routine/require getting used to (or too strong in general), and that this concentrated/no frills delivery is going to include issues like stickiness/grittiness. There are no additional products in the bottle to drive products deeper into the skin, or create a smoothing effect on the skin. This goes for the variety of The Ordinary products, not Alpha Arbutin specifically.",acne,fair,combination,5,LadyMacbe

It's great for the hyperpigmentation left behind from blemishes and it's gotten my skin to look so good that I'm comfortable wearing no foundation some days.
To address some things I saw other reviews say:
It's slightly tacky but I would in no way describe it as sticky. It has never pilled on me, no matter if I applied my foundation with a buffing brush or beauty blender. The only way I can see this as a problem would be in you're not layering your skincare properly, or not allowing the serum to dry down before you start applying your makeup (which really only takes a minute, if that).
Also, sunspots and sun damage ARE NOT what this serum is for. The only way to really ""fix"" that is to see a dermatologist. This product is for lightening dark spots left behind from acne, and it does an excellent job. My step-sister and I both use this product (she is much darker than I am, about NW45 and I am NC15) and it works well for our dark spots.",blackheads,light,oily,5,jfayeirwin

I also feel like the acne scars on my cheeks lightened up a lot and on my temples. When I get acne in those areas (especially the cheeks) I kinda just have to accept that I’m going to get a scar. My skin loves having scars and has them for months. This really helped lighten them up if not at least shrink their size. I also had a weirdly darker forehead than the rest of my face. Idk if it’s because it would just get more sun and thus be naturally darker, but the product helped the overall tone of my face. Love it!!! I suggest using this after the nicinamide.

So when the line went on sale on the ap I bought almost the whole range of products.

I normally live in a tropical climate and coming to a cold, dry climate has wreaked havoc on my skin.  Dry, scaly patches all over my face and neck no matter how much I moisturized and oiled (and I have a huge high-end skincare collection) and acne at the same time - come on!  I was trying everything and this serum is the only one that got rid of my dry flaky patches, and turned my skin into soft, porcelain texture, and OVERNIGHT.  This is an example of less is more folks.  You don't need a million ingredients to address a million problems you just need one that does what is says it will do!

A note on the texture.  Since this serum does not contain any skin-damaging alcohol like many serums, it has a thicker texture and is sticky when you first put it on.  The product does absorb beautifully but you need to wait a lot longer than a normal commercial serum before layering on any other skincare products or makeup.  I made the mistake the first time of only waiting a minute, layering on top of this the niacinamide serum for my acne spots, and so the serum pilled when I put on my moisturizer.  But I have since found that these two steps prevent pilling and leave me with baby soft, non-sticky skin:

1. If using more than one The Ordinary serum, I mix them together in my palm first then pat on, as opposed to layering one on top of the other.
2. I let the serums completely absorb before applying any other products

And that's it!",acne,tan,combination,5,mon3237

Honestly, I MUCH prefer The Ordinary’s HA (and you just can’t beat the price point) because rather than paying for yet another “all in one” product, I can break out my HA and add it underneath whatever cream I feel like using that night or morning. I love using this on my hands under moisturizer, too. Yes, it can be a bit thick, so do use sparingly. No real scent, which I appreciate. I have very sensitive skin and acne prone skin, and after 2 weeks of use, I haven’t noticed any redness, irritation, or other signs of skin stress. Rather, my skin is softer, more luminous, and it’s much less dry, lines are less deep. I live in Colorado and our dry air means I can always tell when a product TRUELY moisturizes well, or it it’s garbage. This stuff works, folks. I combine mine with a few other serums (targeted peptides) and sometimes I use a dry face oil on top of the cream (again, Colorado). This HA doesn’t “ball up” or peel, or leave a cast on your skin.

Unfortunately I didn’t notice a huge difference. I tried using it different ways, changing up when it was used in my skincare routine. Everything was just meh. However, I feel like when I mixed it in with a very water moisturizer it helped my skin really soak in the moisture. Also, it can be a bit tacky after application.

I do not like that. it has a sticky consistency which I was excited about because I thought it would be great under a foundation but it isn't.

I read an article recently about how you shouldn’t use too much moisturizer because it will weaken your moisture barrier and you should use moisturizers with active ingredients that already occur naturally in your skin — like hyaluronic acid. I have oily/combination skin, and this serum is so hydrating without being heavy. My skin feels so soft and hydrated, and it doesn’t make me more oily at all (because that’s not how hyaluronic acid works, unlike other moisturizers that can clog your pores, break you out, etc. with humectants or other moisturizing ingredients that your skin doesn’t already produce on its own).

However in the end I'm ok with spending more on a quality product than spending nickels for a subpar serum. In my experience, most pure HA formulas feel like water and apply invisibly, but this one is so gloopy and thick. Plus it actually foams up almost like soap when applied to your skin. It feels tacky, doesn't fully absorb, and you can forget about wearing underneath makeup or applying SPF on top because it pills horribly. I'll finish using the rest of the bottle on my neck and chest, which shouldn't take long since you can quickly deplete a bottle of this stuff with regular use (I'm talking 2-3 weeks).

I bought this to help with basic dryness around my eyes, and occasional dryness all over my face, and to seal in my hydrating serums.  The texture is like a light paste, sort of like spackle for your walls.  It warms up nicely and goes on smooth, leaving a satin sheen on the skin that was dewy/plump and not greasy/oily.  You don't need a lot.  However, for me this was not good, as it clogged my pores and oddly did not help very much with my dryness.  I've been on accutane so my skin does not get clogged easily.  In fact I'm able to use moisturizers and oils much heavier than this and have no issues with pores.  I would put on a nice layer as a finishing ""seal"" for my nighttime skincare routine, and wake up with parched skin that sort of felt like paper.  For the price I'm not very disappointed, and I'm actually confused that the ingredients in here didn't really work for me.  Perhaps this will work for you.

It’s got Glycerine in it- so it will never fully sink in and may feel like it’s sitting on the skin. Despite being a somewhat heavy moisturizer it is not oily, and will not give you a ‘glow’. And because it is Glycerine-based, this goes on as a last step- even if you use it with skin oils. That said- it’s amazing. I have combo/oily skin and I use a lot of actives, and it’s nice to have a basic, gentle, heavy moisturizer to lock my treatments in at night. Now that my skin is used to it and I’m used to the feeling of it, I even wear it during the day sometimes. It’s silicone-free and fragrance-free, and it’s inexpensive enough that I usually keep 2-3 tubes on hand just in case, and don’t feel bad if I use it as a hand cream in a pinch (it’s great for that too).

I bought this, the azelaic acid, and a couple of their foundations (called Colours). I'm 37, and have noticed my skin getting drier each year, and I had tried so many expensive moisturizers, hoping to find that perfect thing that truly worked. I was unsure this one would work on dry skin, and when I asked the staff there, she said it's great for all skin types. I was skeptical but for the price decided to get it anyway. It is, hands down, the best moisturizer I've ever used. My skin feels moisturized, not flaky, yet not oily either. I put it on in the morning followed up by spf, and at night too. If I want a little something more at night I'll add a few drops of argan oil or something similar. It does not have any added fragrance, but I prefer that since my skin can be a little on the sensitive side. If you are also looking for that One that will help your dry skin, get this. If somehow it isn't the one for you, well at least you didn't have to spend much!

I found that it tends to leave white streaks on the face and seems to not be absorbing well when it's rubbed on the face. I've learned to tap the product into the skin instead of rubbing it. By doing so, the white streaks disappear and product seems to absorb better and faster. Moisture wise, I can see people with normal, oily and combo skin love this product. As somebody who has very dry skin, it's definitely not enough for me. I need to use this in conjunction with the Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil to give it more moisture.

Feel: yes it stings. But if your used to using a lot of acids in your skin care, it isn't anywhere close to the burn of tea tree oil on an open pimple. I think its a pleasent tingle, but i can see how those with sensitive skin would be uncomfortable.

Not a big problem because I use this at night or on days when I don't go out but still, pilling's just not something that's fun to deal with, right?

There is another product I prefer to this one for Vitamin C (another Ordinary product that is not yet on Sephora), but this one is very inexpensive and with some trial and error you can make this one work.

If it becomes too much just calm the skin with a heavy moisturizer, but try not to moisturizer right after if you can wait as I find this gives the product time to do it's job without deactivating the vitamin c with the water in moisturizers.

The Ordinary,Skincare,P427410,73,$5.80,3.7671,Vitamin C Suspension 23% + HA Spheres 2%,brown,brunette,"I've been using this product almost every day for about a week, but I've already noticed a slight improvement in my skin's tone and texture. I didn't experience any burning, tingling, or sensitivity the way others have experienced. However, I've used other serums that contain relatively high amounts of vitamin C for the past 2-3 years, so my skin may be accustomed to it. I still recommend testing it on the back of your hand to see how your skin reacts, even if you're used to other products with high concentrations of vitamin C. The gritty texture of this product was uncomfortable the first time I used it, but I figured out how to make it work for my skin. Here is what I recommend based on what has worked for my skin so far:

1. Use it every other night until your skin gets used to it and you no longer experience any sensitivity. I've used it almost every single day, except for one day in the middle of the week, without side effects.
2. Use only a pea size amount. The first time I used it, I used almost twice that much and it was too much for my skin to absorb.
3. Mix in a couple of drops of facial oil if you'd like. I have combo skin and it absorbed really well (I used marula oil). This could reduce or prevent some flakiness or dryness you might experience, especially if your skin is very dry to begin with.
3. Only rub it in for a few seconds and then gently tap it into your skin. The gritty texture won't disappear no matter how long you try to rub it in. It'll continue to feel gritty and unabsorbed until you add moisturizer.
4. Wait for it to set for about a minute before you add moisturizer. I've been alternating between this brand's and a different brand's moisturizer. I think almost any moisturizer works well with it, but these are the only ones I've used with this it so far. The gritty texture completely disappears as soon as I add moisturizer. The greasy feeling disappears after 10-15 minutes. 

This is what has worked for me so far. Good luck!",blackheads,medium,combination,4,ctovar0726

Pros: It's cheap. It helps to fade post-acne spots. My skin looks much better when I use this. 

Cons: The texture. It may cause redness if you are sensitive to actives (if so take it easy on other actives/acids and use every other day). 

So why am I giving something that actually improves the texture and tone of my skin only 3 stars?

I couldn't justify regularly using a more pricy Vitamin C product on my body. For lightening red marks and scars (in my case, left over from mosquito bites that I itched too much and a relatively fresh scar from burning myself cooking), it works well for body. It also has reduced some residual sun damage that I have on my neck (because I always seem to miss a spot with my daily sunscreen use and the damage adds up). 

I was expecting the worst with regard to the texture, but after discovering that it is only slightly gritty and the feeling disappears after rubbing it in, I tried it on my face. It feels very similar to the Keihl's vitamin C serum, which I liked but broke me out. It doesn't have as much of a bad ""processed meats"" smell as other pure Vitamin C products do. I don't find the texture feels great under face makeup, so I only use it a couple times a week, when I know I won't be wearing face makeup, but I have been able to reap the benefits from that occasional but routine use. 

I don't think that there will ever be a pure Vitamin C serum that is completely pleasant to use (and the pleasant ones are made from Vitamin C derivatives which may not be as effective), and given the amazing price, I will definitely be repurchasing this again and again for use on both face and body.

The only side effect is that it's a tad greasy and pills if you rub your skin after it dries. The greasiness settles after 30 minutes though.

It was too gritty to wear alone so I mix this with my Caudalie Vinoperfect serum and then apply in the daytime before moisturizer.

It really works, love it!

I try to apply it and give it at least 20 minutes to sink it before applying anything else, but it always leaves my skin in a sort of peely flakey state afterwards.

This lasts me a really long time, i opened my second bottle last night January 2, 2017. 

Anyways, this has made my under eyes brighter and has never failed to make it look like I've gotten enough sleep. This does sting a little when it gets close to a random opened pimple so it might not be the best thing for someone with sensitive skin.

After about 2 weeks of using this i realized ""wait this is caffeine, i don't just have to use this around my eyes. I can put it all over my face."" Caffeine is high in antioxidants which aids in anti aging by fighting off free radicals, it constricts small blood vessels/improves circulation (which is the whole idea with reducing dark circles), reduces inflammation and redness, reduces inflammation and you know.. reduces inflammationnnnn. 

I already knew these things before using this product, but because it is marketed as something for the eyes, that's what i was using it for. But after it hit me 2 weeks later, i started using this all over my face. it soothes my redness, and inflammation when my skin is having those bad moments, and also when i have a pimple here and there, it helps to reduce their size and redness.

I don't put this all over my face everyday, just when my skin is acting up. This is an awesome product not just for the eyes, hopefully it works the same for others the way it did for me, cause everyone's skin is different, but this is what worked for me",acne,medium,oily,5,AndrewMars7

Now shockingly, I don't have undereye bags or wrinkles around my eyes (a lifetime of wearing sunglasses in every weather WORKS!!) But I figured, why not try this over the entire eye area? It DOES say to work this around your occipital bone, and that goes around your entire eyeball, so I figured it couldn't hurt.)

It sinks in really fast and keeps my skin clear and texture free. I notice my skin goes back to being terrible if I stop using it.

I've been using it regularly for about six months now and it's been so good to my skin. It applies very nicely, had very little irritation for the first week or so and I haven't experienced any irritation in months, it is not very drying. It's helped with my skin texture immensely, it helps get rid of smaller bumps and smooth out any rougher patches. It leaves my skin very soft and smooth. It's helped reduce fine lines a little bit. I believe it has also helped reduce oil production in my T-zone although the product doesn't make any claims like that. An excellent product made even better by the price, I'd highly recommend this.",acne,fair,oily,5,Vartox
