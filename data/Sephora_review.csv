P38217,"Good cleanser, but...","I've been using Murad's ""Vitalic Energizing Pomegranate Cleanser,"" but I'm always on the lookout for new and better products so I thought I'd give this one a try. The cleansing cream did a good job of removing every bit of dirt, oil and makeup from my skin and it did a good job of keeping my skin exfoliated and my pores unclogged. It left my skin feeling soft and hydrated. However, the Murad ""Pomegranate Cleanser"" is a two-in-one dual-purpose product that cleanses and tones in one step and saves me time since I don't have to use a separate toner product after cleansing. The first time I used it I wanted to test to see how clean it actually got my face so I used my regular toner on my face and the toner pad came away completely clear—no dirt or makeup left behind at all. So I know that it really does cleanse and tone my very oily skin in one step as it promises. It smells great and lathers easily. The pump dispenser is very convenient, too. Even though the ""Resurgence Cleansing Cream"" is a good cleanser, I am going to stick with the pomegranate cleanser because of it being a cleanser and toner all in one.",4,,oily,fair,,tenngal,,e0dba6b7-ab8b-4627-9139-3206448cf75f

Tonight I put this stuff all over my face and will keep it on overnight. It feels like aloe vera gel when applying but when dry it is so lightweight and calming. It is not as hydrating as some other masks but that's not what I'm looking for out of this. I cannot say enough good things about this face mask. Will be purchasing the tub when I run out of my sample.",5,,,,,artsychick16,,25543ebc-21cb-4b73-b79b-581ac62e2777

I have had acne since I was a teenager, nothing too terrible but consistent and I was never comfortable without a full cover, full face of makeup.

One of the employees suggested for me to replace my mosturizers with this product and use it in small amounts and rub it in, don't wash it off. A week later I noticed my blemishes were smaller and nothing new was forming. Here I am maybe 2 months later with blemish free skin!

P382204,A must over any skin products,"First of all I would like to mention to all that follows me as well as those of you that have recently found my reviews. Thank you all for following me as I do buy many products from Sephora from makeup to face regimes. I have never been a big fan of PTR however. This Cucumber Gel Mask Extreme Detoxifying Hydrator is the next best thing other than Heaven. I normally never try 1000s of samples I get through my orders, I did original get the Peter Thomas Roth ULTIMATE ANTI-AGING MUST HAVES with 500 points as I have tried the whole set. I absolutely fell in love with the Cucumber Gel Mask so in my last order I ordered the full size jar and I own and use many face serums, eye serums and moisturizers that I buy from Sephora and Dillard's which I have wasted a lot of money on products that ""claim"" there is so many out here is just that! Now to this product, if you are one with combination to dry skin buy this I promise you'll not need another moisturizer or face mask! (for over night) please read about use with makeup below).This product does state to apply to a clean face, allow to sit for 10 minutes then wash off it also claims to leave on your face over night for a Extreme Detoxifying Hydrator as I use this 2-3 times per night in a week if my face is extremely dry, redness it is mild enough to use every day and I have. My skin has never felt so refreshed, hydrated and baby soft in 20 years. I am now 50 and it is harder to find something that works as it claims for more mature skin, this product is the best for the purposes I have honestly listed below.This product does wonders for any skin type, dry, dry patches, redness,and combination skin types. i don't have oily skin therefore I can't make any promises there but i am sure of how this product applies a bit sticky while applying it but it dries into a soft non stick smooth thin layer on your face with a cooling effect you can actually feel working into the skin. (I do refrigerate mine) this is not a must however, I do find it to feel very cool and helps to open my pores when I do apply it. As I sleep it is dry and smooth until the next morning and it don't transfer off onto your clothing or pillows.I do recommend in using a good face primer before using makeup (foundations, concealers and powders) as this product will dry as a thin mask. It is suitable for any ages including acne prone skin. I have used the Estee Lauder Night repair complex II for three years now as I swear by it too. I use the EL when my oily part of my face around my T bone, outside of my nostrils, over my brows when I see red bumps or acne from oils that only appear in those areas at times. I have now found by using the PTR over that product or my face serums it works much better and seals in any night serum I may have on. I also have found by using this product alone without any serums it works just as well and leaves my face almost flawless the next morning.There is nothing I can say is bad about this product and I am glad I did give PTR a chance as I stated I have never been a big fan of PTR products until this came in and I will always keep a jar on hand no matter the season, it is that wonderful! Wake up with a hydrated face with a soft clean texture. If you have severe problems such as breakouts, severe acne or severe irritated skin I would be safe to say give this product 2-4 nights. If you just need a hydrated look from dry or patchy skin give it a night. You can honestly feel it working within 10 minutes after the product has fully dried. Thumbs up PTR for finally making a product stands to more than it claims!Look no further!",5,,,,,DebbieEMS27,"{""very hydrating"",cooling,""for all skin types"",moisturizes,""soft skin"",sooths,refreshing,""must have!""}",bc66c9c7-32ba-4f8d-80b8-31e4a0da9d36
P382204,AMAZING FOR ROSACEA!!,"I suffer from moderate rosacea and I am always trying different skin care products to soothe my face. My T-zone is oily and my cheeks are dry. When my rosacea flares up they get red with acne like bumps (but it's not acne) and my face has a hot, burning, feverish feeling which is miserable. I applied this mask in a thin layer all over my face including my T zone and left it on over night. It did not feel uncomfortable leaving it on and it was completely absorbed by morning. The best part is, while my cheeks are still pink today, they are not as red, the bumps are disappearing, and the best part is that the hot and burning sensation is completely gone! My face felt so hot for 2 days straight then after using this mask one time over night it significantly improved my rosacea flare up...this will be my new go to overnight mask!!! It's lightweight but hydrating, non oily, and no strong fragrance. I highly recommend this to anyone!

As a trial, I've used it here and there over the summer hoping that my skin would liven up and become soft and supple again. I don't reccommend this product if you have super dry skin because it's really not working for me. My skin had been SO dry that it felt flaky and not soft and smooth, putting this on was just really 'meh.' It barely dented the ""armor"" so to speak. My skin type is I guess ""thick"" and that's why it's good to exfoliate all the time, which I do, but only helps the surface of my skin.

It is best on dry skin but you can leave it on for a few minutes or ten, depending on how much you want to unclog everything. My skin is noticeably smoother--pores are reduced, too!

I bought the full size product and use it almost daily - sometime a thin layer overnight and sometimes a thick layer for 10 minutes before putting my makeup on. It really does make your skin glow.

I have oily/combination skin, that is fair, semi sensitive and acne prone- that's where this stuff has been a holy grail for me. It's incredibly calming and soothing when I have a flare up on my face. When i break out, I do my normal skin care routine, then use this as the final step before I go to sleep at night. When I wake up, my skin is brighter, the redness from the break out has significantly gone down and my skin is way less irritated. My face feels hydrated, but not oily. There is no residue. Having oily skin, I tend to get a dull complexion a little more quickly than others- this is awesome after exfoliation at night to fight that as well. I don't like to use acne products, because it dries out my face and well.. I'm 29 and I want to keep my face wrinkle free for as long as I can.

As I was reading the ingredients (cucumber, pineapple, aloe, papaya) I was expecting a strong fruity-cucumber smell but the aloe-cucumber scent is very light and hard to detect once on. I would definitely repurchase this. I didn't give 5 stars because the effect is very subtle, and those who do not have a lot of redness, dryness, and sensitivity might not notice any difference.",4,,,,,Jackie0321,"{hydrating,soothing,gentle}",cb50efc3-28a6-457e-b099-7116b1b44470

I learned about the product first through the free mini facial Sephora had at my store so I bought the set.

No intense hydration or ""detoxification"", whatever that is supposed to be. I'd even say my skin is slightly on the dry side, with the beginnings of rosacea on my nose and cheekbones, so it seems like this mask would be a good fit for me, but I've used it about 3-4 times already and haven't noticed any difference in my skin.",3,,,,,demidevi,,bfb60784-3339-42a1-8ed8-f6d46bd136f0

P382204,Not worth the price,"I've been wanting to try this for a while, so I was happy to get a small jar in a PTR gift set when I redeemed my VIB points.

I have combination/dry skin and my skin didn't feel moisturized or softer at all, just kind of tight. To be honest it doesn't feel any different from cucumber aloe gel you apply after being in the sun, so I don't think the price is justified.

P382204,refreshing,"This is kind of a strange product. I purchased it thinking it would be a good lightweight moisture mask. It says that it hydrates but on my dry skin it doesn't really hydrate at all. It sinks into the skin and absorbs completely after about ten minutes, and leaves my skin feeling tight and dry. I'm not sure what they mean by detoxifying, but I haven't noticed any difference in my pores or blackheads. One thing this IS good for, is that it is very soothing and has a cooling sensation when you put it on. Because of this, I like to use it after exfoliation or if I've had a little too much sun. The downside is like I said it absorbs quickly, so the cooling/soothing effect is short lived. The directions also say that you can use this as a light layer over moisturizer, which I do after my nighttime routine. It does seem to make my skin feel a little softer in the mornings, but not so much that this is a must-have product.

If you get an eyebrow or lip wax, it works amazingly to calm irritated skin and it doesn't clog pores.I use it for 10 or 15 minutes but it says you can use it overnight if you want.

I bought the full-sized version as soon as I ran out of the mini size and I've used it every day since. This is really nice if you put it in the refrigerator before applying - feels really cool and refreshing on your skin - but it's still awesome even if you just leave it in your bathroom like I've been doing recently.

She had this cleanser listed as one of the things she couldn't live without. I had always heard good things about Dr DG but never tried anything. I picked this up, and within two days noticed a difference in my skin. I have been breakout free for two weeks now, and I really believe it has to do with this cleanser. Its so gentle, but my face feels so clean afterward. And its amazing at taking off water proof makeup if you just take your time with it and gently rub it into your eyes.

P382353,Its okay,"I have tried a few oils, and this is about average compared to the others. My main issue is the smell. Many of the other reviewers love the smell, but I just can't stand it. It is very strong and sweet. Maybe it would be interesting on pancakes, but I don't like it on my face. It is also thin and kind of greasy. Thicker oils seem to absorb into the skin better. This sort of creates a sheen over the face. I only use it at nighttime, so this isn't an issue for me. But, I'm not sure the beneficial ingredients are making it into my skin cell layers.

P382353,Too oily,"I really wanted to like this product. There have been so many positive reviews about, and it came highly recommended by the BA at the store. Though it has a pleasant smell, and it feels very pleasant upon application, it leaves an oily sheen behind. At first, I thought I was applying too much of the product, so I decided to use only one drop on my entire face... Nevertheless, I still looked oily all day. I thought I was being paranoid until a coworker came up to me and said, ""darling, you look a little oily today, I have some powder if you want to use it"". That was the day i only used one drop! Yes, I tried wearing foundation and powder over this oil to reduce the shine, however I found that throughout the day the oil seemed to break my foundation down and by the end of the day I had hardly any foundation left and my setting powder seemed to have settled In my pores. I experiment several days with this oil under my foundation and each time experienced similar results. Although, I do believe this is a well formulated oil, and I do enjoy the process of applying it, it just isn't a product that seems very practical for daily use. I can't wear it alone because of the oily residue leaves behind, and I can't wear it under foundation because it seems to break down the formula.

I do dampen my skin (like the instructions say to) with caudalie grape water just prior to applying and it feels like a dream. SO soft, SO hydrated and SO non-greasy.

P382353,The jury is still out on this one,"I've never been a facial oil person, more into serums. So I gave it three weeks before I wrote this review. It does have an immediate and visible firming effect on my skin. And it has evened out my skin tone slightly. I only use it at night as I'm hesitant makeup may slide off if I use it in the morning. At first, I followed the instruction and only used two drops. That is not enough at all. Even for my combination skin, I need at least 4 or 5 drops (done over the sink as it splatters when the oil comes out of the pump). PLUS I need to put my regular moisturizer on top. The oil has a herbal smell, and it does linger if you use it alone.

I am definitely not a fan of the tropical/coconut smell, but this stuff is exactly that, but much more subtle & luxurious. The product itself really works - it's thin so it dissolves into your skin quickly and gives your skin an extra layer of moisture while not making it overly shiny. Compared to Tarte Maracuja, the Dilo Oil absorbs more quickly because it's thinner, smells better, and might be a smidgen more effective. But because it is thinner, it's not as moisturizing I would say. But neither oil is a stand-alone moisturizer anyway - you definitely need an actual moisturizing lotion after this, especially if you have dry skin.",5,,,,,pineappletrees,,b663f262-b9a9-491a-aa5a-8480079ac550

I tried this for a week and it really had no effect on my skin. My skin is so dry that after I wash and dry my face, my skin feels as tight as if I had on a dried clay mask on-- I was hoping this oil would help that, but it just made my skin, well...oily. It didn't seem to absorb at all. And because of that, my makeup did not go well over it. It didn't make me break out at all, it just didn't help.

Most of any moisturizers make me break out so its a big gamble for me to try new products. I got it originally as a sample from Sephora. Since I have a sensitive skin with tendency to bad break out from some cosmetic products, I first tried it on my hands. I put them on the back of my hands before bed and I was brown away by how smooth and soft my hands were next morning. Truly, I have never experienced anything with such a dramatic result over night. My hands were visibly smoother, softer and really 10 years younger looking. So I tried on my face too. Well, the out come was to as magical as on my hands, but my sensitive skin did not break out and was very soft and moisturized. The beige color thick cream has somewhat unique herbal kind of smell but I personally think it's not a problem. Little goes a long way so even the small sample tube lasted me a whole week.

P382355,Korea knows skincare.,"So far so good. The winter throws my skin some serious blows. On the perimeter of my chin, around my mouth, nose, small parts of my cheek, and on my forehead get irritable dry patches and its just such a battle to find a product that will assist. I turned to natural remedies for a long time, highly absorbent coconut oil mostly, as a sealer of moisture, but the oiliness of the coconut oil made makeup application a little bit messy. I spent over a year in Korea, and Dr. Jart is everyywhheere. Korea has an enormous, overwhelming, skin care market, so its nearly impossible to know whats hoopla and whats legit, so I ignored it. Upon returning to the states, and seeing Dr. Jart on Sephora and other leading dept. sites, I decided to give it a try, and am glad I did! Once the cream is available, I will pair it with that for a full skin care regimen, but with just this liquid, the dry patches are gone, my skin isn't irritated, and my face is actually touch-ably smooth. Thank goodness. Side note: apply to skin when the skin is moist but not wet. Im so used to applying moisturizers when my face is still a bit wet, but this formula gets kind of lost in the moisture.

That said, I've always been very selective about purchasing KS products because I find other brands to be more effective for my skin. Other than Age Arrest, I use the KS Detox Cleanser and Clearing Mask. I have combo/ very oily T zone which is hormonally triggered. I found Age Arrest to be too heavy for my skin after about a week so discovering that it works around my eyes has been wonderful. I have been using this cream for almost 4 weeks now and I can say I've seen a remarkable improvement in hydration and crepiness under my eyes. I find that the less expensive more natural products that I prefer just don't cut it for me in the eye area, so I was thrilled to start using this just around the eyes! I use half a pump and dot it around my eyes: including the brow bone area, corners and underneath. I'd go easy on the upper eye/lid/brow bone just in case you have some sensitivity but I found I don't get any irritation whatsoever.

But feel like the sample worked better. Use it with Clarisonic. It makes my skin squeaky clean but not drying,4,,dry,,,SimplyJ,{cleansing},e485d894-1a7a-4110-899c-ce6fd58656e7
P382968,Very foamy!! Great light weight,"A pea size is all you need and this thing lathers like crazy! I have oily skin, and this tends to make me feel a tiny bit dry and a little tight, but it works great! I like using this in the morning since its gentle but still very effective. I use a different cleanser at night that is more heavy duty to get off the daily grime. This cleanser is perfect for in the morning and works great with the Clarisonic!",5,,combination,,,Bsam,{foamy},d11dd679-f270-4cd2-b6f2-71c00f3cda80
P382968,"",This is a very foamy cleanser once you lather it. A small pea sized drop is more than enough. It effectively removes make up and my acne has been better since using it. It does dry my skin out a bit but I always follow washing my face with moisturizer anyway. My skin does seem to be less sensitive. Would buy again.,4,,combination,,,LadyeLL,"{foamy,drying}",d66bc207-cbeb-4f84-b08f-f2d479f6ab91
P382968,Completely clears my skin,"I used to use the blue Pureness line from Shiseido and switched off since I started getting worried about wrinkles and wanted to find products that were more for wrinkle prevention. However, I started breaking out. I didn't want to go back to the blue line of skincare products since my face didn't feel as oily as it used to be.",5,,combination,,,JetsetterChris,{foamy},6a9d26bb-6409-49e0-891d-d18b67e87e50
P382968,great for sensitive skin,I've been using this for a few months and it is great for my sensitive skin. I have combo skin and this does a great job of balancing. I love the way it lathers and you only need a little bit to get the job done !,5,,,,,Squishybrush,,6a5f50f8-22dd-4eb6-a2f4-ff6d8f192cae
P382968,Gentle but effective,"I have been trying and trying to find a good cleanser that would not upset my super sensitive skin, FOUND!

P382968,"",I tried this product out and the smell was very strong. The product foamed nicely and helped cleanse away make up. It dried out my skin though and left it looking dull and a little red. I won't be using this again.,3,,combination,,,lavant,,b2674ead-bf05-432b-b1fb-bb9f63f9f1be
P382968,Good but Heavily Scented,"This is a nice cleanser, my skin feels clean when I use this, but I feel this cleanser would be better suited for the warmer months as I find it a bit drying for the winter weather. Also, this has a heavy perfume scent which I don't like. As much as I would like to love this product, I can't. I won't be repurchasing.",3,,combination,,,NicBB,"{foamy,milky}",e9b7e18b-e7d3-4861-957d-a821a02e4454
P382968,"Good product, cant stand the smell","Good product but couldnt get past the smell. I am sure that this product is really good for the skin, it has great reviews and the brand is very established, however I couldnt get over the smell, it was like my grandmother, which is nice but not what I want to wash my face with every day. Its a great product, just not for me.",3,,,,,jlbo9876,,13795025-bdec-46fe-8a7d-c88ae991b15f
P382968,"Gentle, cleansing, and works well with Clarisonic","I have combination skin that's pretty senstive, and most cleansers are much too drying or harsh for me. This stuff has been great. I was initially skeptical that it would work for me, as I still have hormonal breakouts and this lacks salicylic acid, but I've really come to like it. You only need a TEENY TINY bit (the bottle will seriously last you forever! I've had it for 2 months now and it barely feels less empty than the day I bought it) and it'll foam up, which is especially good for using with my Clarisonic Mia. It removes dirt and makeup, leaving my face feeling clean but not overly tight/dry (it is a little drying, but I'll only notice if I don't use any moisturizer afterwards). I'm not sure what other posters are talking about with it being exfoliating, as it's one of the creamiest cleansers I've used. There is a mild smell, but it does't really bother me. I do miss the kind of minty tingle that salicylic acid/alpha hydroxy cleansers give, but this one seems a lot nicer for my skin.",5,,combination,,,CultOfMadness,"{foamy,milky,gentle,creamy}",5b83f75b-a7b2-4f7b-ab61-7a33dd4590c2

P382968,Very good cleansing foam for every skin types,"This is by far the best cleansing foam I have tried.

P382968,Love it!,"I have a very hard time finding facial cleaners that do not make my skin breakout. Even skin clearing cleansers. After reading the reviews on the IBUKI Gentle Cleanser, I decided to try it. I have been using it for about 3 weeks and my skin hasn't been this clear AND this soft in years. You only need the smallest drop for your entire face and neck. The downside is it does feel like it leaves a thin film on your skin right when you wash it. But once your face dries, your skin just feels soft and clean.",5,,combination,,,monkey831,,33b98abd-ddcb-4111-845f-9fa974f4132f

P383181,had no idea what I was buying,I thought this was a face primer. So I bought it as such. I then realized it's part of a system. Oh well! I still use it. I put it on before my foundation and it seems to work just as well as a primer.,2,,,,,lisadoeslife,,e882d9a4-5e64-4acd-8fef-d5793460b703
