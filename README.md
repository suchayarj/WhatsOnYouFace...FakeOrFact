# MOTIVATION

As a continuation from my previous project What's on Your Face... Be Honest( https://github.com/suchayarj/WhatsOnYourFace...BeHonest) where I utilized One-Class SVM to identify authentic reviews on Sephora
I am attempting to improve the model's accuracy by utilizing Deep Learning method and see if the Neural Network including MLP and LSTM work better at identifying.

# WORKFLOW
- Test model on Yelp reviews where the labels are available (True/Deceptive)
- Tune model
- Apply the model on MakeupAlley and Sephora dataset

# ANOMALY DETECTION WITH MLP


# ANOMALY DETECTION WITH LSTM

# FUTURE WORK
- I am working on creating Google Chrome Extension where users can see if reviews they are looking at are authentic or not based on my machine learning model
